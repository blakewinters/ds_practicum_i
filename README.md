# Practicum I: Prosper Loan Analysis

## Project Summary

Prosper is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform that allows both individual and institutional investors to provide loans to other individuals. This marketplace is unique in its ability to circumvent traditional banks or money lending companies in providing needed funds to individuals. This has the benefit of giving individuals with low credit history or other traditionally negative financial characteristics the opportunity to receive a loan.
  
In the following study, I will be analyzing just over a million loans ranging from 2005 to present. The goal of the project is to predict which loans will provide the best investment opportunities using defaults as the target variable. Due to the binary nature of default status, this will be a classification exercise. The task included acquiring and joining together multiple datasets, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning the data, selecting features, and finally building and executing predictive models.
